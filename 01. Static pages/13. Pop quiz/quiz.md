1. Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I 
   call `root.render()`?

into the root element

2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:
```
console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>)
```
An Object

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
root.render(
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
You can not render more than one element

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

declarative: what to do, imperative: how to do

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

extract code to functions to call multiple times without redundancy
